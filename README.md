# Professional Blog Project

## Overview
Congratulations on embarking on the journey of web development with PHP! This project empowers you to showcase your skills through the creation of a professional blog. As a PHP developer, this blog will serve as a platform to exhibit your talents and make a compelling impression on potential employers or clients.

## Project Structure
The project involves developing a professional blog website with two main groups of pages:

- **Pages for All Visitors**
    - Home Page
    - Blog Posts List Page
    - Blog Post Detail Page
    - Edit Blog Post Page
    - Footer Menu

- **Administration Pages**
    - Accessible only to registered and validated users.
    - Ensure the security of the administration section.

## Development Constraints
- Development without WordPress, building everything from scratch.
- Integrate external libraries via Composer if needed.
- Mobile responsiveness is mandatory.
- Consider using Twig for templating (recommended but not obligatory).
- Secure the administration section, granting access only to users with "administrator" rights.
- Eliminate security vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection, session hijacking, PHP script uploads).
- Host the project on GitHub, collaborating through pull requests and committing in English.
- Create and manage issues (tickets) on GitHub, written in English, covering project tasks.
- Follow SymfonyInsight or Codacy for code quality, aiming for a minimum silver medal on SymfonyInsight.
- Adhere to PSR standards for clean, understandable, and maintainable code.
